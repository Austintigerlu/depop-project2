# Marketplace 

## Description

A clothing marketplace that features the industry standard shopping features. A user comes to the site and dictates what it is that they want to purchase after thorough selection of select jewelry, mens clothing, and womens clothing. Interactive features that make it simple and basic for the user to come in and purchase what they want, when they want with only a few clicks.

## Planning

- Dictated that the framework for our database comes from mongoDB
- Wireframes indicative of our design philosophy
- Functionality that lets customers add to cart with a simple, yet modern display, ease of use.
- Different tools for customers to navigate and search for their needs with ease through navigation bars.
